This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python bug involving silent failures due to a function returning None instead of raising an exception. The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code; `bugSolution.py` shows the improved version. The bug involves a function that returns `None` upon division by zero; in many cases raising an exception is much better and more robust error handling approach.
